BMI stands for Besal Metabolic Index. It is a measure of fitness, based on height and weight of an adult individual
Usually it is measured in Kg/meter-square units (i.e. weight/(length2)). 
E.g. if your weight is 70 Kg and height is 1.7 meter, then your BMI is : 24.2215 Kg/meter-square
Its range is:- under-weight< 18.5 <= normal < 25 <= over-weight

BMI can be calculated using the formula: Mass / Height2 where Mass has units of kilograms and Height has units of meters.
